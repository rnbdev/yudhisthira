Privacy-first lightweight communication protocol for decentralized permissioned networks.

Set up a mesh network of nodes. Establish a messege-based communication system in minutes. Privacy-first design ensures no information leakage. A number of zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) based communication templates are provided for abstraction.

## Use cases

- Audit
- IoT

## (Tentative) Overview and Goal for showcase

- Spawn a number of nodes.
- Each node have a directory of nodes.
- Nodes communicate with each other.
- Each communication is privacy-focused.

## Roadmap

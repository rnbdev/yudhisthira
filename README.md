# Yudhisthira
Privacy-first communication protocol for decentralized networks providing interoperability in multi-vendor platforms.

Set up a lightweight mesh network of nodes. Establish a messege-based communication system in minutes. Privacy-first design ensures no information leakage. A number of zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) based communication templates are provided for abstraction.

## Use cases

- Audit
- IoT

## (Tentative) Overview and Goal for showcase

- Spawn a number of nodes.
- Each node have a directory of nodes.
- Nodes communicate with each other.
- Each communication is privacy-focused.

## Why open-source?

We are open-sourcing Yudhisthira from the very start for well thought-out reasons:

- a privacy-first application requires industrial-grade scrutiny of its cryptography suites. Opening the application up from early stage enables a broad spectrum of cryptographers, cypherpunks, and corporate to work together.
- This protocol is meant for providing interoperability in multi-vendor platforms. Thus, it is aligned with the goal to build towards an open-source standard.

[Milestones](https://github.com/getonchain/yudhisthira/milestones) and [Projects](https://github.com/getonchain/yudhisthira/projects) provide a transparent view of the project.
